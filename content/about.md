# About  

Welcome to **Freeze the Pint**, where I explore the world of homemade ice cream—one scoop at a time.  

I'm Carl, a **Site Reliability Engineer** with a love for ice cream and a knack for experimenting. While I’m new to making it, I enjoy testing flavors, tweaking recipes, and occasionally diving into random experiments—all in the name of science.  

Expect successes, failures, and plenty of ice cream along the way.  

Got a tip or a flavor idea? Reach me at **[carl@freezethepint.com](mailto:carl@freezethepint.com)**.
