I've never been a fan of strawberry ice creamâ€”it usually tastes too artificial. But could making it from scratch change my mind? To find out, I whipped up a pint using fresh strawberries and a few simple ingredients. The recipe I reviewed is from [A Latte Food](https://www.alattefood.com/homemade-strawberry-ice-cream/).

The recipe calls for 2/3 to 1Â½ cups of strawberries, depending on whether you puree them or leave them chopped in the base. I chose to puree them for the smoothest possible base, using 1 cup of strawberries.

The base churned for about 15 minutes. Unlike most recipes I've tried that overwhelm the Ice-21, this recipe worked perfectly in the machine. I'll definitely scale up the quantity next time since there was plenty of room.

### **Flavor: 18**


The flavor was clean and refreshing. However, after working through two scoops, I found myself wanting more strawberry intensity. As a stand-alone dessert without mix-ins, this recipe would benefit from additional strawberries.


### **Texture: 20**


This surprised me, as I expected more ice crystals to formâ€”especially given how quickly the base churned to solid form. I think the texture score could be higher if I hadn't pureed all the strawberries. The puree method left some gritty texture from the high concentration of strawberries in the base. Keeping some strawberry chunks might have reduced this grittiness.


TIL: The "seeds" on the outside of a strawberry are called achenes. Each achene is actually a tiny, dry fruit containing a seed. The red, fleshy part of the strawberry isn't the true fruit at allâ€”it's an enlarged receptacle that holds these achenes. ðŸ¤¯

### **Appearance: 20**


Compared to the artificial coloring of commercial strawberry ice cream, pureeing fresh strawberries creates a more subdued appearance. While small gritty particles are visible in the base, making it somewhat plain, the natural strawberry color is authentic. Adding strawberry chunks would have made for a more visually appealing dessert.


### **Aftertaste: 17**


After one scoop, the aftertaste was hardly noticeable. After two scoops, a coating developed on the tongueâ€”not the most unpleasant, but definitely present.


### Final Score: 75



[alattefood.comâ€™s Homemade Strawberry Ice Cream recipe](https://www.alattefood.com/homemade-strawberry-ice-cream/) was a solid choice! Iâ€™d definitely make it again, but next time, Iâ€™ll include strawberry chunks to enhance both the flavor and texture while reducing the grittiness. This might also improve the aftertaste and mouthfeel.
